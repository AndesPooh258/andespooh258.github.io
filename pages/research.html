            <h3>Privacy-preserving Machine Learning</h3>
            <img class="pic-w-600px" src="/img/research/ppml.png" alt="ppml"/>
            <p class="justify py-2">Due to the recent advances in machine learning, machine learning and deep learning models have been widely adopted. However, with increasing regulation on the technology sector, the use of these models as a service raises privacy concerns. We develop efficient privacy-preserving algorithms to ensure that neither corrupted client nor server can obtain sensitive information from other parties.</p>

            <h3>Scalability Issues of Blockchain</h3>
            <img class="pic-w-600px" src="/img/research/blockchain.png" alt="blockchain"/>
            <p class="justify py-2">The high latency of the underlying blockchain restricted the number of cryptocurrency transactions per second, making them difficult to replace the traditional transaction methods. We focus on the micropayment application, in which processing these transactions individually is expensive. We design off-chain protocols to support fast and scalable micropayment on cryptocurrencies.</p>

            <h3>Automated Machine Learning</h3>
            <img class="pic-w-600px" src="/img/research/aml.png" alt="alt"/>
            <p class="justify py-2">The performance of machine learning algorithms is highly affected by their hyperparameters. Finding out optimal settings requires much time, and the process is error-prone. We facilitate automated machine learning in two directions: the first one is to model the hyperparameter tuning procedure as a bilevel optimization problem and solve it; the second one is to apply relaxation techniques to reduce the search space of hyperparameter tuning. We also investigate whether we can use these techniques in recent hot topics such as privacy-preserving machine learning and contrastive learning, which make machine learning more accessible to the business world.</p>
